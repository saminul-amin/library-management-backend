# üìö Library Management System API (with TypeScript, Express & MongoDB)

## Project Overview

A clean and RESTful **Library Management API** built using **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB** (Mongoose). This delightful backend project helps you create, read, update, delete, and borrow books. Yes ‚Äî books! Because reading is still cool in 2025.

---

## Features

- Add, update, delete, and retrieve books
- Borrow books (only if they‚Äôre available, duh)
- Business logic: No borrowing more than available copies
- Automatic stock management after each borrow
- Aggregation summary: See how many times each book was borrowed
- Validations using Mongoose schema rules
- Mongoose middleware and instance methods (a little backend sorcery)

#### `GET /api/books`
Query books (with `filter`, `sort`, `limit`)

#### `GET /api/books/:id`
Retrieve a single book by ID

#### `PUT /api/books/:id`
Update a book‚Äôs fields

#### `DELETE /api/books/:id`
Remove a book (RIP)


### üì¶ Borrow

#### `POST /api/borrow`
Borrow books (only if enough are in stock)
```json

  "book": "64ab3f9e2a4b5c6d7e8f9012",
  "quantity": 2,
  "dueDate": "2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"

## üí° Developer Features

* Type-safe interfaces (`IBook`, `IBorrow`) so you don‚Äôt mess up fields like `copiez` instead of `copies`.
* Centralized error handler (no stack trace explosion on your terminal).
* Clean folder structure (as if you really care about scalability on a 3-page API, but still ‚Äî why not?).

## Conclusion

This project was designed to demonstrate key backend development concepts using **TypeScript**, **Express**, and **MongoDB (using Mongoose)** ‚Äî and you‚Äôve just implemented them all like a pro.

From validating data to handling business logic and even generating aggregation reports, this API is well-structured, easy to extend, and ready for real-world use.
